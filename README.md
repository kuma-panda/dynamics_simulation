## Description
This software was designed to teach the fundamental dynamics to highschool students.  
Simulation features is available associated to 'diagonal throwing' and 'movement on a plane with friction'.  
Any physical coefficients (i.e. velocity, throwing angles and heights ...) can be modified and you can see the result with animation immediately.
